	<h3>Our leaders rise to seek control
	<h3>Of artifact with gaze so cold
	<h3>Black sphinx begins to seal its hold
	<h3>With ancient power to reach its goal
	<br>
	<h3>Treaties broken, their vows forgot
	<h3>A single goal, with greed they sought
	<h3>To have within their grasp alone
	<h3>That which shimmered in blackest stone
	<br>
	<h3>[CHORUS]:</h3>
	<h3>History cries its blackened tears
	<h3>Is anyone left who yet hears
	<h3>The only answer winds that pass
	<h3>Forlorn amidst the desert of glass
	<br>
	<h3>In their lust they turned the key
	<h3>Rage unleashed, the genie freed
	<h3>Blinding tempest of creation
	<h3>Mutually they assured destruction
	<br>
	<h3>Reflected in the broken shards we see
	<h3>Visions of what we once could be
	<h3>A future now in chains without a key
	<h3>Frozen in glass for all eternityy
	<br>
	<h3>[CHORUS]</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>[SOLO]</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>With lion body and head of man
	<h3>There it stands admist the sands
	<h3>Falsely spoken promise of power
	<h3>The black sphinx called
	<h3>And we answered!
	<br>
	<h3>[CHORUS]</h3>
