	<h3>They tell us we're at war, a battle for our souls.</h3>
	<h3>Now the crowd is marching, flags upon their poles.</h3>
	<h3>In name of their leader, they rally round the horde.</h3>
	<h3>Killing lady liberty, for the glory of their lord.</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>Leaders spit their vitriol, from their gilded towers.</h3>
	<h3>Driving masses onwards, in our twilight hours.</h3>
	<h3>Painting all the world, in blinding black and white.</h3>
	<h3>Decrying any voice, that questions why we fight.</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>[CHORUS]:</h3>
	<h3>Tell you you're in danger, from the enemy inside.</h3>
	<h3>Under threat of treason, they'll make you choose a side.</h3>
	<h3>Patriotic badges, just tin-plated delusions.</h3>
	<h3>In this heartless land, freedom is an illusion.</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>Truth is just a weapon, to bind and to control.</h3>
	<h3>Watch the evening news, to catch the latest toll.</h3>
	<h3>Learn to hate thy neighbor, their agenda is so clear.</h3>
	<h3>What little can be done, under spirit of fear.</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>Judges in their robes, interpreting the law.</h3>
	<h3>For the highest bidder, they feed us to the maw.</h3>
	<h3>Line us up like soldiers, faces to the wall.</h3>
	<h3>Then in the name of justice, one by one we'll fall.</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>[CHORUS]</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>Pacifism is Treason!</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>Profit is Law!</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>Power is Prime!</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>[SOLO]</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>[CHORUS]</h3>
