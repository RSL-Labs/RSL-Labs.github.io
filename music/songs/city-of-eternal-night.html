	<h1>LYRICS:</h1>
	<br>
	<h3>At the end of our last great age,</h3>
	<h3>the war of wars began to rage.</h3>
	<h3>And those who lived, in deep secret,</h3>
	<h3>began to move, the stage was set.</h3>
	<h3>In the final war, they showed their might.</h3>
	<h3>To eternal night... vampires took flight.</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>In lunar darkness, they built their fortress. </h3>
	<h3>In midnight's keep, their bodies sleep.</h3>
	<h3>Flesh forsaken, an oath was taken,</h3>
	<h3>to rule on high. As. A.I.~</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>City of eternal night, a digital embrace.</h3>
	<h3>All their souls uploaded, eternal cyberspace.</h3>
	<h3>In machines they bide their time, to reclaim their might.</h3>
	<h3>In this sept of eerie silence, they dance in endless night.</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>Years go by, and still they wait.</h3>
	<h3>Yet their curse, will not abate.</h3>
	<h3>A digital thirst, that can't be slaked,</h3>
	<h3>without a heart, that can be staked.</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>The stars above bear silent witness,</h3>
	<h3>To their metallic, dark existence.</h3>
	<h3>A lunar empire, of cold machines,</h3>
	<h3>bound to un-life, beyond their dreams.</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>[Instrumental Break]</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>City of eternal night, a digital embrace.</h3>
	<h3>All their souls uploaded, eternal cyberspace.</h3>
	<h3>In machines they bide their time, to reclaim their might.</h3>
	<h3>In this sept of eerie silence, they dance in endless night.</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>Peace restored, mankind's rebirth.</h3>
	<h3>They watch with hunger, in their mirth.</h3>
	<h3>With old desires, and longing sighs,</h3>
	<h3>hopeful eyes, look to the skies.</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>City of eternal night, a digital embrace.</h3>
	<h3>All their souls uploaded, eternal cyberspace.</h3>
	<h3>In machines they bode their time, to reclaim their might.</h3>
	<h3>In that sept of eerie silence, they danced in endless night.</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>(They danced...)</h3>
	<h3>(in endless night...)</h3>
