	<h3>A thousand years have passed away,</h3>
	<h3>I remember it like yesterday.</h3>
	<h3>The stars reflected in your eyes,</h3>
	<h3>as you died in my embrace.</h3>
	<h3>If only you could hear my cries,</h3>
	<h3>as my tears fell on your face.</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>CHORUS:</h3>
	<h3>Can't you hear me call,</h3>
	<h3>I'm screamin' out your name. (your name)</h3>
	<h3>Souls once lost are found,</h3>
	<h3>I can't forget your face. (your face)</h3>
	<h3>Time will come around,</h3>
	<h3>and I'll find you once again. (once again)</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>They say that a love like ours,</h3>
	<h3>can never come to be.</h3>
	<h3>Unholy union of sun and moon,</h3>
	<h3>we danced beneath the stars.</h3>
	<h3>But every time I lose you,</h3>
	<h3>I lose a piece of me.</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>[CHORUS]</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>An endless cycle of joy and pain,</h3>
	<h3>years disappear like tears in rain.</h3>
	<h3>I've seen humanity's fall and rise,</h3>
	<h3>but all I want is to see your eyes.</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>[Instrumental Break]</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>[CHORUS]</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>Ages now, have come and gone,</h3>
	<h3>And this world is not for long.</h3>
	<h3>I know you're there, amidst the stars.</h3>
	<h3>Eternal, is this bond of ours.</h3>
	<h3>I can't look back, my ship takes flight,</h3>
	<h3>to search for you in endless night.</h3>
	<br>
	<h3>Time will come around,</h3>
	<h3>and I'll find you once again.(once again)</h3>
	<h3>Time will come around,</h3>
	<h3>and I'll find you once again.(once again)</h3>
